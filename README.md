# TypeScript-Exercise-13
Let me break it down for you step-by-step.

1. *Declaration of the Array:*
Host: "First, we declare an array called `emptyArrayOfTwoStrings`. But wait, this is no ordinary array. We're telling TypeScript that this array will hold something special. It's an array of tuples! And each tuple will have two strings. Can you believe that? We specify the type as `Array`, making it super clear to TypeScript what we're working with. Neat, right?"

2. *Adding Elements to the Array:*
Host: "Now comes the fun part! We start adding elements to our `emptyArrayOfTwoStrings`. And guess what? Each element is a tuple with not one, but two strings. Wow! You can see that we use the `push()` method to add the tuples. Each `push()` statement adds a new pair of strings to the array. It's like building our collection of string duos!"

3. *Logging the Result:*
Host: "Lastly, we want to see the magic we've created, right? We use good old `console.log()` to display the contents of our `emptyArrayOfTwoStrings`. And voil√†! We get an array of tuples with two strings in each one. It's like a double dose of awesomeness!"
